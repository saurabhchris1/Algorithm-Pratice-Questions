# A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
#
# Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
# If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
#
# You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.
#
# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2,
# or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
